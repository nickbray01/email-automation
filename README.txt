Should be pretty fucking obvious,
but I'm going to include this.

1. Format excel sheet so email addresses
	are in first column, names are
	in second column
2. Literally just copy paste the first
	two columns into email-input.txt
3. Edit the subject and message of
	message.txt. Don't edit the thing
	that's labeled DONTTOUCH. Leave
	HelloREPLACENAME the way it is,
	I take care of formatting within
	the script.
4. Double click auto-emailing.py
5. Put in password when asked.
6. Make good choices with newfound power
	and free time
