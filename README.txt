Should be pretty fucking obvious,
but I'm going to include this.

1. Extract file to a folder on the
	desktop. The name should be 
	email-automation-master
2. Format excel sheet so email addresses
	are in first column, names are
	in second column
3. Literally just copy paste the first
	two columns into email-input.txt
4. Edit the subject and message of
	message.txt. Don't edit the thing
	that's labeled DONTTOUCH. Leave
	HelloREPLACENAME the way it is,
	I take care of formatting within
	the script.
5. Double click click-me.sh
6. Put in password when asked.
7. Make good choices with newfound power
	and free time
